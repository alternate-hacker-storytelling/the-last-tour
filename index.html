title: Hacker Storytelling

<p>Hacker Storytelling is my way for telling stories using the Internet, in a way that is open by default. Hacker Storytelling uses several tools to help me tell stories, that is completely stored and operating using Github.</p>
<p>There are several key technologies that I employ:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Github Pages</strong></a> - A quick, easy and lightweight way to host websites on Github allowing anyone to build site with HTML, CSS and Javascript.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll#readme" target="_blank"><strong>Jekyll</strong></a> - Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website.</li>
    <li><a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Mustache Templates</strong></a> - A simple way to render structured data from JSON files, using basic HTML templates for displaying--instead of pulling directly from database.</li>
    <li><a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Deck.js</strong></a> - A JavaScript library for building modern HTML presentations. deck.js is flexible enough to let advanced CSS and JavaScript authors craft highly customized decks, but also provides templates and themes for the HTML novice to build a standard slideshow.</li>
    <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Gists</strong></a> - Gist is a simple way to share snippets and pastes with others. All gists are git repositories, so they are automatically versioned, forkable and usable as a git repository.</li>
    <li><a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank"><strong>D3.js</strong></a> - D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.</li>
</ul>
<p>These technologies provide a simple, client-side toolbox for telling stories using:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pages - Static HTML pages, using the Jekyll framework</li>
    <li>Blog - Chronological blog posts, using the Jekyll blog</li>
    <li>Data - Structured data lists and detail pages</li>
    <li>Presentations - Simple, flowing presentations</li>
    <li>Code - Code samples and snippets in Github Gists.</li>
    <li>Journeys - Static publishing of pages, using the prev / next format.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm looking to push the boundaries of how I use Github, and employ some unique approaches to running sites and applications on the social coding platform. I use this combination to drive my apps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>master repo - I store the backend of applications in private github repositories.</li>
    <li>gh-pages repo - I store the public website for any project in the gh-pages repository.</li>
    <li>github api - I use the Github API to add, update, and manage pages, data, and other elemtents.</li>
    <li>oauth.io - I use OAuth.io to authenticate with the Github API, and manage application / project access.</li>
</ul>
<p>These basic tools, plus the open, browser-based hosting environment introduced by Github, makes for a rich, online storytelling format. This new approach to storytelling is not just about words, Hacker Storytelling is about weaving in data and code, to make my stories richer and more meaningful.</p>
<p>You can see this in action, running the many different projects that make up the <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist network of research</a>. Everything runs as separate Github repositories, with individual subdomains for each project.</p>
